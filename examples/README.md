maxcdn examples
===============

All examples may seem to a be a bit overly complex, but that's because (a) the documentation
has examples for pretty much everything and (b) these are intended to be fully functional
and useful tools for interacting with MaxCDN's API.

All examples use a configuration file as it's last means of getting `alias`, `secret` and
`token`. See individal example `help` for addtional options available in your configuration.

```yaml
---
alias: YOUR_ALIAS
token: YOUR_TOKEN
secret: YOUR_SECRET
```
